## About

The random password generator is a useful tool for creating secure and unique passwords. It helps users generate passwords that are difficult to guess, providing an added layer of security for their accounts and sensitive information.

The generator allows users to customize the length of the password and choose the types of characters to include, such as lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. By offering these options, users can create passwords that meet the specific requirements of different websites and applications.

## Usage

1. Open the password generator in your web browser.
2. Click on the "Generate Password" button.
3. A prompt will appear, asking you to enter the desired password length (between 8 and 128 characters).
4. Enter the desired length and click "OK".
5. A series of confirm prompts will appear, asking you to select the character types to include in the password.
6. Click "OK" for the character types you want to include and "Cancel" for the ones you want to exclude.
